## ðŸ§  Multi-Agent Conscious Habit Layer
A decentralized swarm of **autonomous agents** that:
- Track real-time digital and offline behavior patterns
- Identify self-destructive habit loops
- Trigger interventions based on emotional, environmental, and biometric context

Agents communicate via secure inter-agent messaging and operate in a **consensus-based cognitive state** to avoid false positives.
