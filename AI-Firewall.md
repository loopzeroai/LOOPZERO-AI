## ðŸ”¥ AI-Powered Access Firewall
LoopZero's AI firewall is a **proactive defense layer** against behavioral triggers. It:
- Detects high-risk environments and digital stimuli (e.g., accessing triggering content)
- Sends real-time alerts and offers AI-guided decisions
- Integrates seamlessly with Solana wallets and dApps to **block impulse purchases**, redirect mental attention, or freeze access temporarily

Each firewall rule is managed by a **smart, self-evolving multi-agent system** that learns and adjusts over time.
